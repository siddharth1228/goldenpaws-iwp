# goldenpaws-iwp
Golden Pawsâ€™ is an online application that can be used to purchase or sell dogs. The system
accepts any valid user to register and allows him/her to sell or purchase a dog. Furthermore, they
can even rate or comment on the breed of other dogs. This aids in the decision-making process of
non frequent customers.
