# issues

-	aria-owns circles
-	module hierarchy (and what is exposed)



index
query (matches, querySelector, â€¦)
attrs (getRole, getAttribute)
name (getName, getDescription)
atree (getParent, getChildren)

name -> query? (attrs may be sufficient)
name -> attrs
name -> atree
query -> attrs
query -> atree? (should query walk the DOM or the ATree?)
atree -> attrs
